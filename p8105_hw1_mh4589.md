## Problem 1

Load the penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the dataset

The penguins dataset contains information on three different penguin
species (Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo). Here are the important variables
of the penguins dataset:

**Species**: The species of the penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo).

**Island**: The island where the penguin was observed (Biscoe, Dream, or
Torgersen).

**Bill_length_mm**: The length of the penguin’s bill in millimeters.

**Bill_depth_mm**: The depth of the penguin’s bill in millimeters.

**Flipper_length_mm**: The length of the penguin’s flipper in
millimeters.

**Body_mass_g**: The body mass of the penguin in grams.

**Sex**: The sex of the penguin (male or female)

The data set has 8 columns and 344 rows.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 milimeters.

The scatterplot was constructed with bill length on x-axis and flipper
length on y-axis. I used color = species to categorize by species.

``` r
ggplot(penguins,aes (
  x=bill_length_mm, 
  y=flipper_length_mm,
  color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bill Length vs Flipper Length for 3 Penguin Spcies",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

## Problem 2

Created a dataframe named rnorm_df with 4 different vectors - norm_samp,
logical, character and factor.

``` r
#create a 10x4 data frame. Length is 10. 4 different vectors 
rnorm_df = 
  tibble (
    norm_samp = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
    vec_character = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("level 1", "level 2", "level 3","level 1", "level 2", "level 3", "level 1","level 1", "level 2", "level 3"))
)
```

I used the pull function to calculate the mean. The mean function only
works for norm_samp because it is a numeric column, and for vec_logical
because TRUE is assigned a value of 1 and FALSE is assigned a value of
0. The mean function does not work on the character and factor vectors.

``` r
mean_norm_samp =  mean(pull(rnorm_df, norm_samp))
mean_norm_samp
```

    ## [1] -0.2308926

``` r
mean_vec_character = mean(pull(rnorm_df, vec_character), na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(rnorm_df, vec_character), na.rm = TRUE): argument
    ## is not numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_character
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean_vec_logical = mean(pull(rnorm_df, vec_logical))
mean_vec_logical
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(rnorm_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(rnorm_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vec_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

When I applied the as.numeric function, I was able to calculate the mean
for the logical and factor vectors, but not the character vector. This
is because the as.numeric function assigns value 1 for TRUE and 0 for
FALSE to the logical vector, and it assigns values 1,2,3 for the 3
different levels in the factor vector, but it cannot assign numeric
values to characters in the character vector.
